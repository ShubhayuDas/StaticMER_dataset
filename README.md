Dataset used in paper titled "A Regression Approach to Long-term Static Music Emotion Recognition on Classical Music using Small Feature Sets"

The data set consists of (2*34)+2 = 70 features of 330 calssical music recordings. The recordings were taken from the MusicNet website of the University of Washington [Thickstun et al. 2017]. Feature Extraction was performed using the 'pyAudioAnalysis' library [Giannakopoulos 2015]

Aditionally the ground truth readings of the 'Valence' and 'Arousal' were provided here as well. The ground truth was taken from the response of a classical musician, composer, conductor and teacher, Mr. Anubrata Ghatak of Kolkata Music Academy.
